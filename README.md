This should be a simple project! Now let's make it complicated...because we like challenges! 

The scope of this project is to build a new web-based app for investors in european companies, with a simple to use frontend and useful search/reporting features. More details here: https://github.com/scr53005/eftg-steem/wiki/Introduction-to-European-Financial-Transparency-Gateway-(ETFG)


Firstly let's define the simple tasks: 
A. Build the Private Steem Blockchain. Details: the goal is to build a private network with 6 nodes (withness, full nodes, seed nodes) on 5 different virtual machines with public IPs. The contributor should provide the architecture, full documentation and all the config files. 
Task 
A.1. To setup and configure the private steem blockchain: 2 witnesses, 2 seeds nodes, 2 full RPC nodes. To start the blocks creations and to verify the synchronization between all of them. The private steem network will have its own chainid, tokens supply and config files.
Task 
A.2. Provide a full documentation on how to setup a private steem network, for newbies, will all the needed steps to follow and all the needed requirements. The documentation will be public and accessible to everyone who is willing to test it. Also, the new created steem network will be fully operational and ready to test.
Task 
A.3. On a separate VM, to install and configure a steemit webapp and documenting all the steps needed for someone else to install, configure and start using the steemit on a specific steem private network. 
Task 
A.4. On a separate VM, to install, configure and document the steemdb blocks explorer that works on the private steem blockchain. The documentation should contain all the steps and all the needed requirements for any newbie willing to test it.
