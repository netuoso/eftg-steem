This should be a simple project! Now let's make it complicated...because we like challenges! 

The scope of this project is to build a new web app for investors in european companies, with a nice web based frontend and useful search features. More details here: https://github.com/scr53005/eftg-steem/wiki/Introduction-to-European-Financial-Transparency-Gateway-(ETFG)


Firstly let's define the simple tasks: 
1. Build the Private Steem Blockchain. Details: the goal is to build a private network with 5 nodes (withness, full nodes, seed nodes) on 5 diffrent virtual machines with public IPs. The contributor should provide the architecture, full documentation and all the config files.
